# Secure-Messaging-System-using-AES-and-Socket-Programming
This project implements a secure two-way communication system between a client and a server using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for message encryption and decryption. The communication is facilitated through Java socket programming, ensuring real-time, bidirectional message exchange over TCP. Before initiating the chat, both parties perform an authentication process using a predefined passphrase, enhancing the systemâ€™s security against unauthorized access. Once authenticated, the server securely shares a dynamically generated AES secret key with the client, which is then used for encrypting and decrypting subsequent messages.

The project is containerized using Docker, allowing the client and server applications to run in isolated environments. This setup provides easy deployment, scalability, and environment consistency across different systems. By using Docker networking, the containers communicate seamlessly without exposing sensitive ports publicly.
Overall, the AES Secure Messaging System provides a strong foundation for confidential, authenticated, and encrypted communication suitable for modern distributed applications.
